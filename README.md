# Important Announcement

Well, we had a good run, but all good things must come to an end eventually. ArcOS started as a weekend project back in June 2020. I was a 13yr old high school student with no experience writing away in Notepad++, trying to get something of an OS out of it. It was only because I had figured out how to make DIVs draggable using a w3schools tutorial. It’s often been said that big things start from humble beginnings. ArcOS is no exception.

ArcOS development is no longer entertaining. It used to be, but the thousands of lines of code have really piled up to become more of a chore to work on than anything else. I solved this last year by starting fresh with ArcOS v6, but even that has now come to a halt. I have found other priorities… other projects that really need my attention more than ArcOS. It’s sad that this is how it ends, but as long as I don’t feel satisfied working on this project, I can’t happily keep it in the air either. Soon we’ll say goodbye. It’s the end of my life’s work, and the end of an era for a lot of people. I never thought I would be writing this to anyone but myself, much less to an entire Discord server filled with people solely interested in ArcOS. It’s truly been an honor.

For those of you that are reading this, I recommend you offload your ArcOS Data using [ArcOffload](https://github.com/IzKuipers/ArcOffload) over on my GitHub. Other than that I’ll give you two options: you can either join me in the IzKuipers Community, where we’ll form a fresh group of developers chatting and having fun, or you can stay here until this Discord server gets ultimately destroyed, just like the rest of ArcOS’ infrastructure.

I want to thank everyone for being a part of this amazing journey, and I hope to talk to all of you soon.

### ArcOS is set to shut down on October 1st, 2024. You have until then to offload your data.

> ArcOS source will become public once we're shut down
